# bot.land

This is a TypeScript project that builds code for bots on [Bot Land](https://play.bot.land).

If you're familiar with SC2 units, they include things like
- micro / blink Stalkers that kite enemies
- a unit that specializes in melee combat
- micro "Siege Tanks" (artillery)
- support units (medic, repair, etc.)

# Build

Instructions forthcoming. For now, if you open this project in VSCode, it will mostly configure itself.
